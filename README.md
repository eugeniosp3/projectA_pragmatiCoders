# How does it work?
Look at projectA.py. ProjectA.py is the central document in this project. All of the necessary functions are called from here. These functions call utility functions as needed. 
<br>
<br>
Look at the projectARequirements.xlsx to see how requirements were documented from the provided description and minimum requirements.

# Car Loan Calculator

**Description**
<br>In the US, you can purchase a car with a loan. The car loan will carry an interest rate, taxes, and fees.
Gas prices also influence how much you will pay just to drive each month.
I would like you to build me a calculator which runs in the terminal and asks the user for information relevant to their
upcoming car purchase.
The user should be able to input two vehicles and as much information as you think is relevant to the car buying experience.
You need to think like a product manager about what questions are relevant.
You don’t want the customer answering dozens of questions if not necessary, but you need to get to the heart of the matter.

**Minimum Requirements**
<br>Calculate monthly gas costs based on the MPG/gas efficiency of the car and how much the user drives weekdays and weekends
You must consider how much the user expects each car to cost in repairs and maintenance for 1 year.
The cost of the car loan and interest rate for buying that car. You must take in these two parameters and write a function
to calculate the person’s monthly cost.
Also make sure to include if they want to introduce a down payment or not and that should affect the principal amount of the loan.
(If down payment, the principal is lower.)
The final output of the application/program should be a concise printout of all the information the user submitted as well as a
recommendation as to why they
should buy one over the other and the reasons why clearly outlined.
All of this should be output to the terminal. We do not currently need a fancy UI or anything like that.
